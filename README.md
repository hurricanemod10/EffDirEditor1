# EffDirEditor

This project converts old MATLAB scripts (`WriteEffDir.m`, `IsolateEff.m`, etc.) for working with SimCity 4 EffDir files into Python.  
It also provides a way to build a **standalone EXE** so you can run the tool without needing Python installed.

## Features
- Read `.effdir` files
- Write `.effdir` files
- Isolate specific effects by name or index
- Cross-platform (Python), with Windows `.exe` build via GitHub Actions

## Usage
Once built, you can run:

## Build Instructions
If you want to build the `.exe` yourself:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Use PyInstaller:

Or use the provided **GitHub Action** which automatically builds the `.exe` in the cloud.

## Status
Work in progress â€” based on reverse-engineered MATLAB scripts.
